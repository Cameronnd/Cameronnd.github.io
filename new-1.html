    In this homework assignment, I did not recieve full credit due to the fact that it was late.
    One of my goals in the new trimester is to turn in everything in advance or on time.
    
    
    math, i need to work on my writing and my notebook. I feel that my main problem is the quality of the work that i turn in, sometimes i rush the assignments or forget to do one, and i pay the price for it.
